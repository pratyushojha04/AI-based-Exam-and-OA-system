Question,Answer
1. What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?,"Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models, while unsupervised learning uses unlabeled data to find patterns."

31. What is deep learning?,Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers to analyze various forms of data.
32. Describe the concept of an activation function.,"Activation functions introduce non-linearities into the model, enabling the network to learn complex patterns."
33. What is over-sampling and under-sampling?,"Over-sampling increases the number of instances in the minority class, while under-sampling reduces instances in the majority class."
34. How do you evaluate the performance of a classification model?,"Performance can be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score."
35. What is the purpose of a cost function?,"A cost function measures how well a model's predictions match the actual data, guiding the optimization process."
36. Explain the differences between L1 and L2 regularization.,"L1 regularization adds the absolute value of coefficients as a penalty term, while L2 regularization adds the square of coefficients."
